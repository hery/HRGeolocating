HRGeolocating
=============

A crowd-based geolocating iOS framework
---------------------------------------

HRGeolocating lets you create your own crowd-based geolocating app. It ensures the accurateness of tagged pins by requiring a developer-specified minimum of tags before publishing a pin.  

Building such an app requires a database and an API to store pins locations, so I will open source a Django/postgresql API on Heroku shortly.
